# function (IN-PROGRESS)

When using data fitting and optimization algorithms, a function to fit/optimize must be defined. Without predefining a set of functions for a user to choose from, one must add their function to the source code and recompile before fitting/optimizing.

The goal with this project is to provide a versatile library for defining funcitons at runtime.
